          An intuitive theatrical rights acquisition website
          <br>
          Our UX team worked collaboratively on developing a high-fidelity prototype website. Initially creating mockups in AdobeXD such as the one below.
          <br>

          <br>
          During each sprint we came together and evaluated our current designs before moving on to the next prototype phase.
          <br>
          The image below represents the result of a design meeting and an interface redesign implemented in a high-fidelity prototype.

          <br>
          Over the 20 weeks this project covered, our sponsors presented us with a requirements pivot which changed the basis of our entire design concepts.
          <br>
          We began to redesign and prototype based on the new requirements, as well as create new features.
          <br>

          <br>
          One feature which contributed to the success of the redesign was a social media content generator.
          <br>
          The main users of this system are high school theater programs, and our website was designed to make marketing their productions seamless.
          <br>
          I designed a simple social media post generator which users could populate with their own data and instantly share across platforms to market their production.
          <br>

          <br>
          This generator can be used for multiple types of social media post, allowing for consistency with each production, and convenience for users.
          <br>
          What was important for this project was seeing users needs, understanding the sponsor needs and requirements, and going above and beyond when designing.
