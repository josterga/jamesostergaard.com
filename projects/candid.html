          Description: Goal Management Dashboard in Google Sheets
          </p>
          <p>
          At Candid I found most data is stored in Sheets and manually copied into Google Forms for delivery. When I began in December '19 the data delivery process which was
          shown to me was entirely manual; each data value had to be searched and calculated by hand. These data values are consistent with each day, and I immediately saw a
          more intuitive approach to that process. My concept was a google sheet which held the calculated values for the current day so users could look at it and simply populate the
          delivery form. 
          <br>
          The above image is a mock of how the system should function. It is a tab in a sheet that pulls daily data from another sheet and visualizes it by location total, individual total, and metric total.
          <br>
          All values are added based on the current day which is automatically updated in the blue cell upper right. That cell is changeable for looking back at other days.
          <br>
          I took it upon myself to streamline that process for my team and built a google sheet that automatically displays the values needed to enter in the form. This tool
          decreased the time spent on data entry and locating, but relies on data being correctly entered. Since I have developed this, it has been put to use by two other studios.
          <br>
          The goal was to build an at-a-glance status of the day which could aid in calculating and entering data at close.

          Description: Google Review QR Cards
          </p>
          <p>
          Getting Google review recognition is crucial to the success and traffic flow of a startup, or any business. With this business need in mind, I observed how reviews were presented
          to people, which was mainly verbal and with one stationary QR code at the physical location. I observed the lack of opportunity for people to engage with it and leave a review,
          mainly beacuse of lack of time, and forgetting to leave a review.
          </p>
          I consulted my coworkers and began to design a physical QR code that could be given to people, which would help them remember to leave a review, allowing us to increase those numbers.
          <br>
          The initial design was simple, the QR code, a short instruction with a secondary option in the case that someone does not have access to QR, and the branding and encouragement to leave a review.
          <br>
          This development was focused on printing 20 QR codes on one piece of paper and later laminating for longevity.
          <br>
          Since the introduction of these QR cards our numbers of reviews have increased, and they bring more accessibility an mobility to getting reviews on-the-spot.
