          Design: Pervasive Data Visualization
          <br>
          Development: Data Analysis, Data Combining
          <br>
          Description: EthicsViz helps people look into the pervasive data associated with their digital footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
          The concept was to gather available data from multiple sources; Google Takeout, Spotify Data Request.
          <br>
          The data is available free to the users, as well as companies, and other partners.
          </p>
          <br>

          By building a tool to visualize personal data, we could present to users the kinds of inferrences that companies with access to this data could make about them as users.
          <br>
          The image above is a mockup of a conceptual visualization combining Google Search and Spotify listening history over one particular week.
          <br>
          By marking each data point with a sentiment value, we could reflect the mood of the user and present patterns in their behavior.
          </p>

          Above is a running prototype of the above conveptual visualization. Combining data sources to present hourly sentiment analysis over one week of data collection.
        </br>
        The data is collected by a user and processed through a python script, which outputs the data visualization written in HTML and JavaScript using the D3 Visualization Library.
      </p>
          What was important about this project was understanding what data in a set is important, and what can be expanded. By running data through a sentiment analysis processor, we were able to bring a new element into the visualization and create a more intuative presentation of users' data.
